# A shell implementation written in python

## What is it?

Slynkk is a shell impl written in python. It is a project of mine to learn more about how shells work and to learn more about python. It is not meant to be a replacement for bash or zsh, but rather a fun project to work on.

## How to use it?

To use it, simply run `curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SlynkkShell/Slynkk/master/installer.sh | sudo bash` and it will install it for you. If you want to install it manually, you can clone the repo and chmod +x the `slynkk` file and run it. It is not reccomended to run the shell as root, but it will work if you do.

### Prerequisites

You need python3 and git installed to use it and recieve updates. It will not work without them.
You should also have curl installed, but it is not required.

## How to contribute?

If you want to contribute, you can fork the repo and make a pull request. If you want to add a feature, please make sure to make a new branch and make a pull request to the `dev` branch. If you want to report a bug, please make an issue.

## How to install plugins?

There is no way to install plugins yet, but there will be soon.

## Plugin development

There is no API for plugins yet, but there will be soon.
